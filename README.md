# hdim - High Definition Image Manipulator

This application lets you do basic image manipulation without having to leave your terminal.

To use this application your terminal needs to support TrueColor. The ones that i've checked that support it are:
- VS Code integrated Terminal
- Windows PowerShell Terminal
- iTerm2 / Apple Terminal
- Alacritty / Kitty / GNOME Terminal
